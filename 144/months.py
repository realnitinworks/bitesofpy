       If this fails due to bad inputs reraise the exception.
       Also if the new date is < START_DATE raise a ValueError.

       Then calculate how many months have passed since the
       START_DATE constant. We suggest using dateutil.relativedelta!

       One rule: if a new month is >= 10 (MIN_DAYS_TO_COUNT_AS_MONTH)
       days in, it counts as an extra  month.

       For example:
       date(2018, 11, 10) = 9 days in => 0 months
       date(2018, 11, 11) = 10 days in => 1 month
       date(2018, 12, 11) = 1 month + 10 days in => 2 months
       date(2019, 12, 11) = 1 year + 1 month + 10 days in => 14 months
       etc.

       See the tests for more examples.

       Return the number of months passed int.
